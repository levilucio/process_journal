\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Due to recent advances in Domain Specific Language (DSL) workbenches,
it has become possible to build model-driven development environments
as sets of individual DSLs that get composed for a specific purpose. In
this paper we explore how model-driven development environments can become
process-aware, to assist the user when building a model. We offer an
explanation to our ideas at three levels of abstraction: 1) the meta-meta level,
where brick DSLs are built using the Meta-Programming System (MPS) workbench;
2) the meta level, where brick DSLs are assembled into frameworks that
are further tailored for particular modelling scenarios through the introduction
of an explicit process for model construction; and 3) the model level, where
models are built through progressive tool-guided refinements and automated
steps based on the process introduced at the meta level. We exemplify our
approach by providing the main highlights of the ongoing development of a
model-driven requirements gathering environment for our industrial partners.

\input{text/introduction}

Introduce the problem statement here, something along the following
lines: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item How do we customize a Model-Driven Development environment in order to
  support a given modelling process.
  \item The process should be of an advisory nature and minimally invasive
  regarding the modelling experience.
\end{itemize}
